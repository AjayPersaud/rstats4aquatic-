The first six weeks of the course, i.e. **Module 1**, will cover data science & fundamental exploratory data analysis in R.  It is a brief introduction to contemporary open science, best-practice data management, and some fundamental biostatistical working tools. The primary goal is exploration of tools and approaches associated with effective, efficient, reproducible biostatistical analyses. Inspirations include [software carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org), [rforcats](http://rforcats.net), and many, more open, online, free I can direct you to as needed.
